            India in Pixels has a niche audience that is smart, curious and

              Now that the buzz is out there and people have started recognizing
              us, we can start getting smart people onboard and scale things up
              faster. We currently have two openings.

              <h2>Storytelling Intern</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Who are we looking for?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Someone deeply passionate about India</li>
              <li>
                Has an interest in varied disciplines - pscyhology, music
                theory, linguistics, politics, anthropology while having a style
                of reasoning that allows you to think like a mathematician or a
                scientist
              </li>
              <li>
                Is able to make logical arguments and validate assertions with
                research and facts - even if the topic might be unfamiliar, it
                should not deter you from drafting your take
              </li>
              <li>
                Is an expert at hunting for information from the deepest alleys
                of the Internet
              </li>
              <li>
                Excellent control over language - you need to have a fluid
                ability to write in a manner that is both sincere yet humorous,
                witty yet relatable. It is expected that your write ups will
                liberal use English and Hindi but it is also okay if you just
                write in English.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Your day will involve brainstorming ideas and discussing it with
              the team, take into account the feedback and work on ideas we find
              exciting. You will then spend a lot of time researching on your
              topic and creating an initial draft of a script that will be
              refined over the next few days and be ready for production. You
              also need to know that a script for YouTube is very different from
              an article on Medium - the flow, the rhythm, the style are all
              different.
            </p>
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              Create a script for a YouTube video (that is approximately 4
              minutes long) where you illustrate an interesting academic insight
              with respect to an Indian film, story, painting, song, personality
              or any other entity.
            </p>

            <p>For example:</p>
            <em>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  how Dil Chahta hai personifies the Id, Ego and the SuperEgo
                </li>
                <li>
                  why does AR Rahman‚Äôs music sound so different based on music
                  theory?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Or how do Urdu and Hindi have different personalities - an
                  example of diglossia
                </li>
              </ul>
            </em>
            <p>
              Notice there are two components to your script - an academic
              component that should involve reading up some research
              papers/journals on a topic like psychology, music, economy,
              behavior science - something most people would not be familiar
              with - second, something so ubiquitous we don‚Äôt even think about
              it - like language or a film, a mythological story, or a person, a
              painting, a sculpture, or an ad jingle.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your research should show the viewer a pattern in the universe
              that is unexpected, novel and intriguing.
            </p>
            <h3>Deliverable</h3>
            <p>
              A PDF of your script, with a title - you will upload it in the
              Google Form below.
            </p>
            <h3>Deadline</h3>
            <p>1st January 2022</p>
            <p>
              Your final work should be narration ready. It should be an
              engaging conversation with a friend in a natural flow rather than
              a braindump of research. You are expected to use humor, anecdotes
              and even drama to elicit attention and interest. You will own all
              rights to your work and IIP will not use your work in any manner.
            </p>
            <h3>Stipend</h3>
            <p>
              You can propose your desired stipend in the application link below

            <p>Who are we looking for?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Someone deeply passionate about India</li>
              <li>
                Has an innate understanding of how infotainment videos should
                look and feel - what the right pacing and style should be
              </li>
              <li>
                Is able to execute creative styles throughout the video and has
                varied interests (3D, scene composition, animation, simple cuts
                and transitions)
              </li>
              <li>
                Has great sense of graphic design, can help design thumbnails
                that generate high click rates
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Your day will involve working with narrated audio and collecting
              resources to use in the video. Fir each video you have to create a
              storyboard mentioning all videos that will be used as B-rolls. It
              is of extreme importance that no third party content should get us
              a copyright strike on YouTube. You‚Äôd then edit with the system of
              your choice - preferably Adobe Premiere Pro or After Effects.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are also encouraged to make use of unconventional styles such
              as softwares like blender and Unity to introduce styles that are
              unseen in Indian YouTube.
            </p>
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              Take any explainer video from India in Pixels or a podcast by any
              Indian YouTuber, just use the audio and show how you‚Äôdve edited it
              in your own unique style.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will need to generate the visuals to accompany the audio. The
              final deliverable should be a video uploaded to Google Drive /
              YouTube that is 3-4 minutes long approx.
            </p>
            <p>
              Focus on showcasing your abilities as a designer/editor to show
              your thinking style and craft a video that shows high quality and
              engagement.
            </p>
